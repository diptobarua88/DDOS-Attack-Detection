# DDOS-Attack-Detection
Built an end-to-end detection framework using the CICDDoS2019 dataset and 28 algorithms (18 classical ML, 5 MLPs, 7 deep learning models including a CNN+LSTM hybrid and a Transformer). The pipeline includes EDA, visualization, outlier removal, SMOTE balancing, PCA, LDA, t-SNE, UMAP, and SHAP-based explainability for model interpretation.
